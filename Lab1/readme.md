## Task:

```
Develop a PHP script that determines whether a point on the coordinate plane falls within a given area and create an HTML page that 
generates data to send it to this script for processing.

The R parameter and point coordinates must be passed to the script via an HTTP request. The script must validate the data 
and return an HTML page with a table containing the received parameters and the calculation result - the fact that the 
point hits or misses the area. Previous results should be persisted across queries and displayed in a table.

In addition, the response must contain data about the current time and the script's running time.

```
- For the arrangement of text and graphic elements, it is necessary to use a tabular layout.
- Form data must be submitted for processing via a GET request.
- Stylesheets should be in separate files.
- When working with CSS, the use of attribute selectors, pseudo-element selectors, element selectors, descendant selectors, and CSS styling properties such as inheritance and cascading must be demonstrated.
- The HTML page should have a "header" containing the student's full name, group number, and new option. When designing a header, you must explicitly set the font (fantasy), its color and size in the cascading style sheet.
- Input element padding must be specified in pixels.
- The page must contain a JavaScript script that validates the values ​​entered by the user in the form fields. Any invalid values ​​(such as letters in point coordinates or a negative radius) should be blocked.
